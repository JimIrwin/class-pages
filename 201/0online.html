 <p><i><big>new items</i></big> <b> see Bb for practice for Tuesday's test</b>
 <p>Watch here for new items (also listed below, in the order that the material is covered for continuing to learn, online).
For convenience, the notes and TTQs are in 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0" target="_blank">this folder</a>, in case you want to avoid 
a lot of links.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9h5ra3awqkfpe0/TTQ3%264.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">TTQ &num;3</a>. 
The theory to learn for this TTQ is covered in the first part of these
 <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/raggg6w7mp8tzgg/Notes4Pt2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> notes for TTQs 3&amp;4 </a>, and also by two YouTube videos; 
first, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb8yEniVKeU&list=PLKW460opQJY8sAqYFBfLlxC0bG8n88D4G&index=1" target="_blank"> intro to nominal GDP</a> reminds why nominal comparisons are misleading;
second, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTO4sVa8Jk&list=PLKW460opQJY8sAqYFBfLlxC0bG8n88D4G&index=2" target="_blank"> Interpreting the GDP deflator</a> takes you through the reasoning
that answers TTQ &num;3; this same reasoning applies to any price index (looking ahead to upcoming material).  	
</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9h5ra3awqkfpe0/TTQ3%264.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">TTQ &num;4</a>. 
The theory to learn for this TTQ is covered in the second part of the 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/raggg6w7mp8tzgg/Notes4Pt2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">notes for TTQs 3&amp;4</a>. 
And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y5h-A8VqQM&list=PLKW460opQJY8sAqYFBfLlxC0bG8n88D4G&index=3" target="_blank">this video</a> applies
	that theory to answering a question like TTQ &num;4.</p> 
<p> The materials for TTQs &num;3 and &num;4 are now complete.

<p>Recall, for online learning, we are "teaching to the test," with a series on online learning items, each organized around a TTQ. 
When you write an answer to a TTQ, please consider posting it to our

<h4>TTQ &num; 1</h4>
<p>Our <a href="TTQ1.pdf" target="_blank">first TTQ</a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, we have our first online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKW460opQJY8aIexrq_Gf7O-Lluellrek" target="_blank">"Output, real and nominal"</a>. 
In this series of videos, we explore output comparisons in a 2-good model. 
And here are notes for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0">TTQ1</a> </p> 
<p>BTW There are many other UTube videos that <i>almost</i> cover the appropriate material -- but they use the term "GDP" 
when they are actually talking about "output" (recall that "output" (y) is the concept of total production of final goods, which we can
calculate in our simple models; GDP is a real-world measurement of output, which we can google but which we cannot calculate. 
We cover GDP in the second half of Topic 4). If you can remember to replace the word "GDP" with the word "output," then you might 
find the following videos helpful:<br>	
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfInod6G3TY">How to Calculate Nominal GDP and Real GDP</a> (careful, because this guy uses the word
"output" where we would say "production"; e.g. "output of 100 guitars" in 2015). 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me8_uwk2m-Y">Calculating Nominal and Real GDP</a>; &nbsp;&nbsp;
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2t3Cfrznu0">Nominal versus Real GDP</a>.   
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNfNZ1mIGRE">Real GDP and the GDP deflator</a> includes some material that we will cover later,
 as it introduces the concept of a price index (the "GDP deflator" is the name of the price index for GDP).
<p>If you do find something worthwhile there, please use our <a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>
to tell classmates.</p>
<h4>TTQ &num; 2</h4>
<p>Our <a href="TTQ2.pdf" target="_blank">second TTQ</a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, 
 we have our second online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tohRGhX04kA&list=PLKW460opQJY_GdmMsFwFCgUW6pnZyCHAM" target="_blank">"Real Output -- INP"</a>. 
In this two-part series, we find a problem comparing outputs when inflation is not pure 
 (when price of different goods grow at different rates, so that relative prices change).

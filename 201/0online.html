<hr>
 <p><i><big>newer items</i></big> show up first in this top section (until moved below, where TTQs will be listed in order).
For convenience, the notes and TTQs are available in 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0" target="_blank">one folder</a>, 
in case you want to avoid  a lot of links.</p>
<p><b>Online Test 2</b> will cover TTQs 3, 4, 5, 6 and reading assignment 3. The testing window for grade-raising will be Tuesday 4/14 
from 11:45am-1:00pm and then the test will be available for maintaining grades through the week.</p>
<p><b><i>Reading Assignment &num; 3</i></b> supporting Topic 4 (and covered in OnLine Test 2). Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of 
<i>UMN Principles of Macro</i> <a target="_blank" href="http://open.lib.umn.edu/macroeconomics/part/chapter-6-measuring-total-output-and-income/">Chapter 6</a>
<small>(<a href="https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_principles-of-macroeconomics-v2.0/s09-measuring-total-output-and-inc.html" target="_blank">
alternate link</a>)</small>. Look over sections 6.1 &amp; 6.2 (skipping the part about GNP), then for online testing focus on the following: the four major spending components of GDP (these are important: be able
to identify and describe each), final goods and value added, the value-added tax, the components of GDI (be able to identify and
describe&nbsp;the largest component; be able to recognize the others). I encourage you to&nbsp;skip the last section, "Tracing Income from the Economy to
Households." <b><i>Optionally</i></b>, 
<small><a href="https://openstax.org/books/principles-macroeconomics-2e/pages/6-1-measuring-the-size-of-the-economy-gross-domestic-product" 
 target="_blank">Section 1 of Chapter 6</a> of the OpenStax textbook also covers most of the material for this assignment, 
	with a lot of other material as well, so it is quite long. Maybe have a look, in case it helps? but don't hesitate to ignore it.

<p><b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9h5ra3awqkfpe0/TTQ3%264.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">TTQ &num;3.</a></b> 
The theory to learn for this TTQ is covered in the first part of these
 <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/raggg6w7mp8tzgg/Notes4Pt2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> notes for TTQs 3&amp;4 </a>, 
and also two YouTube videos; 
first, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb8yEniVKeU&list=PLKW460opQJY8sAqYFBfLlxC0bG8n88D4G&index=1" target="_blank">
	intro to nominal GDP</a> reminds why nominal comparisons are misleading;
second, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTO4sVa8Jk&list=PLKW460opQJY8sAqYFBfLlxC0bG8n88D4G&index=2" target="_blank"> 
	Interpreting the GDP deflator</a> takes you through the reasoning
that answers TTQ &num;3; this same reasoning applies to any price index (looking ahead to upcoming material).</p>  	
<p><b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9h5ra3awqkfpe0/TTQ3%264.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">TTQ &num;4.</a></b> The theory to learn for this TTQ is covered in the second part of the 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/raggg6w7mp8tzgg/Notes4Pt2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">notes for TTQs 3&amp;4</a>. 
And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y5h-A8VqQM&list=PLKW460opQJY8sAqYFBfLlxC0bG8n88D4G&index=3" target="_blank">this video</a> applies
	that theory to answering a question like TTQ &num;4. <b><i>Optionally</i></b><small>
<a href="https://openstax.org/books/principles-macroeconomics-2e/pages/6-2-adjusting-nominal-values-to-real-values" target="_blank">
Section 2 of Chapter 6</a> of the OpenStax textbook looks like a thorough treatment of converting from nominal to 
	real values, so you might want to look that over.</small>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/isqsw1kutr1yzf2/TTQ5%266.pdf?dl=0"><b>TTQs &num;5 and &num;6</b></a>. 
The theory to learn for these TTQs is covered in these

<p>Recall, for online learning, we are "teaching to the test," with a series on online learning items, 
organized around typical test questions, listed below (check for updates). When you write an answer to a TTQ, please consider posting it to our

<p> Online Test 1 covered TTQs 1 and 2 </p>
	<p><a href="TTQ1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>TTQ&num;1</b></a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, we have our first online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKW460opQJY8aIexrq_Gf7O-Lluellrek" target="_blank">"Output, real and nominal"</a>. 
In this series of videos, we explore output comparisons in a 2-good model. 
And here are notes for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0">TTQ1</a>. 
<br><small>BTW There are many other UTube videos that <i>almost</i> cover the appropriate material -- but they use the term "GDP" 
when they are actually talking about "output" (recall that "output" (y) is the concept of total production of final goods, which we can
calculate in our simple models; GDP is a real-world measurement of output, which we can google but which we cannot calculate. 
We cover GDP in the second half of Topic 4). If you can remember to replace the word "GDP" with the word "output," then you might 
find the following videos helpful:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfInod6G3TY">How to Calculate Nominal GDP and Real GDP</a> (careful, because this guy uses the word
"output" where we would say "production"; e.g. "output of 100 guitars" in 2015). 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me8_uwk2m-Y">Calculating Nominal and Real GDP</a>; &nbsp;&nbsp;
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2t3Cfrznu0">Nominal versus Real GDP</a>.   
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNfNZ1mIGRE">Real GDP and the GDP deflator</a> includes some material 
		that we will cover later,
 as it introduces the concept of a price index (the "GDP deflator" is the name of the price index for GDP). If you do find 
something worthwhile there, please use our 
<a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>
	to tell classmates.</small></p>
<p><a href="TTQ2.pdf" target="_blank"><b>TTQ &num; 2</b></a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, our second set of videos,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tohRGhX04kA&list=PLKW460opQJY_GdmMsFwFCgUW6pnZyCHAM" target="_blank">"Real Output -- INP"</a>. 
In this two-part series, we find a problem comparing outputs when inflation is not pure (when price of different goods grow at different rates, so that relative prices change).

	<i>&nbsp;Suppose there is news that contrary to popular belief, eating carrots
does not help a person's eyesight.
<br>a. Use supply and demand analysis to explain how the carrot market
would be affected.
</i></div>
	<span lang="EN"><font size="2">
	</font><p><font size="2">Suggestion:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> the supply would increase, which causes the price 
	to decrease, and quantity to increase right?</span></font></p>
<font size="2">	</font><p><font size="2">Response:&nbsp; No, demand would decrease. That reduces both price and 
	quantity; of course you need to show it on the graph. Think about it and 
	you'll see that it doesn't make sense for the quantity to increase here. 
	People won't want carrots so much, and so fewer carrots will be bought and 
	sold in the market.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Student question: &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Would it be plausible to state that you 
would need more information because the producer of carrots would have a lower 
price and a lower quantity but production costs would also decrease because they 
don't have to spend as much to reach the higher quantity? (or for example they 
could sell a farm, or save money on farming equipment/employees).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">
&nbsp;No, we don't need more information -- the reduction is Q does decrease 
production costs, but the reduction in benefit is greater and so the producer of 
carrots will be worse off.&nbsp; Keep in mind that suppliers were gaining from 
supplying the carrots ...</span></p>

		</font><p><font size="2">Comment: draw the model to show that P and Q both decrease. Carrot 
		producers will be worse off (hurt) by both the lower price and the lower 
		quantity. </font></p>
<font size="2">		</font><p><font size="2"><i>Optional discussion: A level students can relate this result to 
		the gains from trade model. They will see that the decline in price 
		gives more of the gains from trade to the buyer, and less of the gains 
		from trade to the seller (i.e. the price drop redistributes gains from 
		trade to the buyer from the seller). And they will see that the decline 
		in quantity reduces the gains from trade. On both counts suppliers' 
		gains from trade are reduced.&nbsp; </i>

		sellers losses/gains in the S&amp;D model (areas called "producer surplus").</i></font><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
<i>&nbsp;Suppose milk producers adopt a synthetic growth hormone that
significantly increases the amount of milk&nbsp; that a cow produces.
<br>a. Use supply and demand analysis to&nbsp;explain the effect on the
milk market.
<br>b. Explain how milk consumers would 
be affected.</i></p><div style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">
			<i>Suppose the hormone doubles the quantity of milk that would supplied
at any given price.
<br>c. Show how much the supply curve shifts.
<br>d. T/F -- Explain -- "the quantity of milk exchanged double."</i></div>
			<span lang="EN"><font size="2">
			<p>Suggestion:&nbsp;&nbsp; the new supply curve would be two times 
			further to the right. If the price stayed the same then quantity 
			would double, but with a normal looking demand curve the new 
			equilibrium will have a lower price and the quantity will be less 
			than double. </p>
			<p>Response:&nbsp; Correct!&nbsp; Be sure to show that in the S&amp;D 
			graph. </p>

				<p><span lang="EN"><font size="2">Comment: decreased Supply will 
				reduce quantity and increase price. Reduced quantity is bad for 
				the farmers but increased price is good for them. Bad weather 
				could be good news (if price increases enough).</font></span></p>

<h2>Topic 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Two Models </h2><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">PPF -- the production possibilities frontier</span> 

<h3><small>Production Possibilities</small> </h3><p>An economy's capacity to produce depends on two things:
technology (---?---)&nbsp; and resources (--? ? ? --).</p>
<p>Technology: knowledge about production (outputs, inputs,
processes, institutions ... ). Technology (knowledge) is of primary
importance because technology is required to have production (outputs
and inputs and processes are all part of technology). </p>
<p>Resources (L K T), aka inputs or factors of production: labor
(L), capital (K), and natural resources (T). Note that the basic
concepts are enough for ECO 201; the detailed discussion that follows
is not required material, but it might help you understand the basic
concepts better. </p>
<p> L stands for labor, which&nbsp;is human time and effort at production (of any skill
&amp; pay -- whether by a dish-washer or a doctor, a movie star&nbsp;or
an usher). Labor includes the skills and abilities which people get from
education, training, and experience. Labor is often described as "human
capital" because "capital" refers to produced resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p> K stands for capital, which refers to produced resources, such as
buildings, machinery, equipment,&nbsp;tools, and raw materials. Capital
means "produced resources" and the production of capital is called
"investment." Note that in finance and in popular usage,
"investment" often refers to buying shares in a company or putting
money
in a savings account; but those are not "investment" in the economic
meaning of the term (those are purchases of assets). &nbsp;Economists
describe education as investment in "human capital" because education
increases the quantity and quality of work a person can do. And
economists refer to
labor as "human capital" because a person's ability to work is produced
from education, training, and experience. In 201, unless otherwise
stated, capital will refer to non-human produced resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>T stands for&nbsp;natural resources -- the naturally occurring
resources
(traditionally land, forests, minerals, oceans and other waters; now we
also include weather and the environment more generally). Sometimes we
will abstract from
natural resources and just talk about human and nonhuman resources
(maybe a good idea since natural resources need to be found and
accessed to be used in production, so in a sense they end up being a
produced resource (capital)).</p>
<p>We can get more output from either or both of more resources
and more technology; the key distinction between the two is that
technology is
non-rival and&nbsp;resources are rival. Non-rival means that
simultaneous use by any number is possible. For example, suppose you
want to cook some fresh corn: boil water, add corn and simmer for 3
minutes. Any number of people can use that recipe at the same
time; but the stove, pot, and water can only be used one at a time. The
recipe (technology) is non-rival, the equipment (capital) is
rival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Real world extension: patent and copyright law is an effort to defeat
non-rivalness. E.g. when one company owns a drug patent (or patent on X) then
it has the
legal right to prevent others from producing the drug (or whatever X
is).]</p>

<h3> PPF Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier</h3>
<p> Math example of a PPF Model (detailed, FYE and not required).
An economy produces 2 goods, food (F, # of loaves) and clothing (C, #
of
suits).</p>
<p>Given its <b>technology (knowledge) and resources
(L,K,T),</b> the economy's PPF is given
by&nbsp; F = 1000 - 0.1C<sup>2</sup> ;&nbsp; (F,
C&gt;=0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font size="+1">Two
key properties: 1) the PPF has a negative slope; 2) the PPF has an increasingly negative slope
(left to right).</font></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><small><font size="+1"><small>Possibly helpful hint: the slope is the cost of the X-axis good
in terms of the Y-axis good given up (and small slope means the X-good has a small cost).</small></font></small></p>
</font>
<br><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"></p>The negative
slope of the PPF illustrates the economics concept of cost. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The cost of
something is the value of what is given up</span> (to get that something).
&nbsp;Thus, if the model economy is producing 30 suits and 910 loaves,
we would say that producing&nbsp;10 more suits would&nbsp;cost 70
loaves, or an average cost of 7 loaves per suit (we could also say that
producing the 30 suits cost 90 loaves, or an average cost of 3 loaves
per suit). If we then went from 40 to 50 suits,&nbsp;it would&nbsp;cost
us 90 suits (9 loaves per suit, on average). &nbsp;Note that we can use
the same logic to describe costs of food production -- starting at 40
suits and 840 loaves, producing 70 more loaves would cost us 10 suits,
or an average cost of 1/7 suits per loaf. <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When
we move to models with more than 2 goods, we will measure costs in
terms of money, but we will still be concerned with costs in terms of
goods.Maybe we'll see a model with suits priced at $40 each, loaves
priced at $2 each, and baseball hats priced at $10 each. If so, one
suit is worth 20 loaves or 4 hats; one loaf is worth 1/20 of a suit or
one 1/5 of a hat; one hat is worth 1/4 suit or 5 loaves. &nbsp;In more
practical terms, suppose
you see&nbsp;a fancy shirt that would cost you $300; the economics
perspective is to think about how much other stuff you could get for
$300. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Inefficient
mean
wasteful (but wasteful of what?). &nbsp;When production is inside the
PPF then it is inefficient, because we are wasting the opportunity to
have more production. &nbsp;More formally, production is inefficient
if&nbsp;it
is possible to produce more of one good without producing less of
another.&nbsp; And production is inefficient if it is possible to the
same amount with less input.
The term "technically efficient" is used to describe production that is
on the PPF (so more of one good cannot be produced except by producing
less of some other good). &nbsp;When production is on the PPF it could
be efficient, but not necessarily -- that depends on how the values of
goods.&nbsp;For example, in the PPF above, if suits are worth $40 each
and loaves are worth $2 each then producing 10 suits and 990 loaves
would be wasteful (because we could produce 10 more suits and 30 fewer
loaves, getting&nbsp;$400 of clothing at a cost of just $60 of
food).&nbsp;</p>
<br>We will use the PPF in a number of ways. &nbsp;Most simply, we move
along the PPF to&nbsp;model changes in resource allocation (moving some
resources from producing one good to producing the other). &nbsp;We use
production points inside the PPF to model unemployed resources such as
in a recession. &nbsp;And we model the effects of changes in resources
or changes in technology by shifting the PPF -- this will be useful for
exploring economic growth and other long-run macro issues.<br><br><br><br>

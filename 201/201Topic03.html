<h2>TOPIC 3: Supply and Demand</h2>

<p>Supply and Demand is the model of a <u>competitive market</u>, meaning that buyers and sellers are 
price-takers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A <b>market</b> (for something) is an arrangement for buying and selling 
(something).&nbsp; A <b>competitive market </b>is a market in which buyers and sellers are 
price-takers. </p>
<p><b>Price-taking</b></p>

<p>A <b>price-taker</b> responds to the market price (because s/he/it does not affect the 
market price; a price-taking agent's individual action has no effect on the 
market price).</p>
<p>A price-taking seller is called a <b>supplier. </b>A supplier sells
in response to the market price and call sell any desired quantity at
that price. It can't charge more than the market price because
________________.<br>
 </p>

<p>A price-taking buyer is called a <b>demander</b>. A demander buys in
response to the market price, and can buy any desired quantity at the
market price.&nbsp; It can't pay less than the market price because
_____________.<br>

</p>
<p><i>Discussion: </i>A buyer whose individual choice affects price is called a <b>price-maker</b> 
and the simplest example is the <b>monopsonist: </b>the sole buyer in a market.<b>&nbsp; 
Monopsony power</b> is the ability of a buyer to reduce price by 
reducing the amount bought.&nbsp; A monopsonist restricts purchases, 
resulting in a lower 
price and lower quantity exchanged compared to a competitive market.&nbsp; 
Possible examples of 
buyers with significant monopsony power include the University as a buyer of 
on-campus 
student labor, and an automobile factory in a small isolated town (but workers 
can move, which limits the factory's power to depress wages). These are cases 
where the buyer may have some perceptible effect on the price (wage) they pay.&nbsp; 
For ECO 201 you can leave the concept of price-maker in the background, but if you 
go on in economics you will see it again. </p><br><h3><font size="5">Demand </font> </h3>


<p>Demand is the model of&nbsp;price-taking buyers. A demander buys in
response to the market price, and can buy any desired quantity at the
market price. Because competing buyers are &nbsp;offering to pay the
market price, the demander cannot get the good at a lower price.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Qd </b>is quantity-demanded; it is the amount that a buyer (or buyers) would be 
willing (and able) to purchase in response to a specified price. Quantity is 
usually a flow variable, for example gallons of gas per month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Demand </b>is the relationship between Qd and price.&nbsp;Keep in mind demand is 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> an amount, so don't use the term "demand" when you mean 
"quantity-demanded."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><b>Law of Demand: </b>the Demand curve has 
negative slope.&nbsp; In words: ceterus paribus, 
quantity-demanded is inversely (negatively) affected by price (e.g. if price increases, Qd 
decreases; if price decreases, Qd increases).</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"></p>

price of a good increases, other choices become relatively more attractive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Supply</h2>

<p><b>Supply is the model of price-taking sellers. </b>A supplier sells
in response to the market price and call sell any desired quantity at
that price. Because competing sellers are offering the good at the
market price, a supplier cannot charge a higher price.</p>
<p><i>Discussion: </i>A seller whose individual choice affects price is called a <b>price-maker</b> 
and the simplest example is the <b>monopolist: </b>the sole seller in a market.<b>&nbsp; 
Monopoly power</b> is the ability of a seller to increase price by 
reducing the amount sold. A monopolist restricts sales, 
resulting in a higher 
price and lower quantity-exchanged compared to a competitive market.&nbsp; 
Possible examples of 
sellers with significant monopoly power include the University as a seller of 
credit hours and a seller of dorm-housing, the power company, and a 
pharmaceutical company with a patented drug. These are cases 
where the seller may have some perceptible effect on the price they receive.&nbsp; 
For ECO 201 you can leave the concept of price-maker in the background, but if you 
go on in economics you will see it again. </p>

<p>0. Equilibrium, when the market price balances S &amp; D &nbsp;(Qs=Qd)</p><p></p><p>1. Adjustments to equilibrium</p>
<p>Excess demand (roughly, a shortage) causes price to _____, this causes Qs to ___ and Qd 
___ so the excess demand ___. &nbsp;There will be excess demand if price is too ____ .</p>
<p>Excess supply (roughly, a surplus) cause price to&nbsp; ____, this causes Qs to ___ and 
Qd ___ so the excess&nbsp; supply ___ . &nbsp; There will be excess supply if price is too ____.</p>
<p>When a market works well, price adjusts instantaneously to keep
shifting supplies and demands in balance. If price is slow to adjust we
may observe periods with either a shortage or a surplus in a market.
When there is a shortage of a good the price is too low; when there is
a surplus of a good the price is too high. &nbsp;In the basic supply and
demand model, the market works well, so price
adjusts quickly to keep demand and supply in balance (equilibrium). </p>

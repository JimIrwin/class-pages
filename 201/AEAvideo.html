American Economics Association has launched an informational video
entitled "A career in Economics . . . it's much more than you
think." The 9-minute film is aimed at prospective or first-year
students who may be investigating economics as a career option but
are unclear how broadly a degree in economics can be applied. <br><br>The
film makes effort to dispel entrenched misconceptions about who
economists are and what they do. Economics can be broadly defined as
the study of human behaviors aimed at finding solutions to help
improve peoples' lives. Viewers are reminded that a degree in
economics doesn't have to be about finance, banking, business, or
government, . . . it can be useful to all individuals and can lead to
many interesting and fulfilling career choices. <br><br>The video
features four individuals offering insights on how economics can be a
tool for solving very human problems and they provide some
interesting perspectives on how they chose economics as a career
path. The film also helps raise awareness about the need for more
diverse voices in the field of economics. </font></font></p></body></html>

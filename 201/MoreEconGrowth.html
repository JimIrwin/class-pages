Prospects for Growth</span> <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">a. Prospects for poor economies to catch-up.</span>
&nbsp;Development Economics: the field that studies how poor economies
can build up their resources and take advantage of current technology
to "catch-up" to rich economies. &nbsp;Until the late 20th Century,
development economists focussed on capital as the key resource (a
tradition since classical economics (Ricardo &amp; Marx)). &nbsp;Now
economists see <span style="font-weight: bold;">human resources</span>
as the key to development and growth, so current development efforts
focus on health and other basic needs of people in poor countries
(especially mothers, babies, and children; see Jolie &amp; Sachs
video). &nbsp;Recent research identifies corruption as a key obstacle
to development in poor countries.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">b. Prospects for continuing economic growth in rich economies in coming centuries.</span><br>Traditionally,
following the classical economists, long-run decline was expected:
because&nbsp;natural resources per person would decline in the long-run
(from some combination of population growing and T declining).<br><br>Two
issues:&nbsp;overcrowding on fixed natural resources (such as land,
minerals, waters) and renewable resources (such as forests and
fisheries), and running out of exhaustible resources.<br><br>Overcrowding
(pop growing, T fixed): classical economists expected population
to&nbsp;grow whenever living conditions were better than a bare
minimum. &nbsp;With fixed natural resources, a rise in population
causes a decline in natural resources per capita. &nbsp;The more
general concern is "overpopulation" -- a concern made famous by Malthus
(<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>Brave New World</span>'s
"Malthusian belts"), who predicted long-term misery for humanity
because runaway population growth would result in starvation.
&nbsp;However it turns out the population growth is only a problem in
poor economies. &nbsp;With economic growth, societies undergo a
demographic transition and population growth slows down.
&nbsp;Economists now view economic growth as the answer to the
potential problem of over-population: if poor countries can get rich
like us, we expect their population growth will slow down (like ours
has). &nbsp;Put simply, in prosperous societies, families typically
have 2 kids; in poor economies, 5 or more kids -- prosperity (along
with empowerment of women) promises to end the threat of
"overpopulation."<br>&nbsp;<br>Running out of exhaustible natural
resources (such as coal or oil). Classical economists also predicted
long-term decline because&nbsp;exhaustible resources&nbsp;would
get&nbsp;used up. In the 19th Century the major fear was running out of
coal. (A level irony: economists now wish we had run out of coal by
now, because coal-buring is a major cause of global climate change).
&nbsp;However, the contining growth of technology has resulted in 1)
discovery of new sources&nbsp;of many resources and 2) new substitutes
(alternatives -- plastics, synthetics, fiber optics, etc). <br><br>Modern
economists are generally optimistic about the long-run prospects for
growth, mostly because we expect technology (knowledge) to continue to
grow, &nbsp;especially if all the people of world get opportunities for
education and to make the most of their lives. &nbsp;(For a US
perspective on this, see the <a href="http://www.heckmanequation.org/content/heckman-101">Heckman Equation</a>).<br> <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Is Growth Desirable? </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Yes -- for welfare (lots already covered here), especially because most of the people in the world are miserably poor (<a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats">~80% get by on less than $3,700 per year</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">World Bank Development Indicators)</span><br><br>No
-- not if it will destroy the planet. &nbsp;Economists recognize that
if economic growth continues without a change in our energy use.&nbsp;
For the pessimist view, as output increases in poor countries, so will
their energy use: if the energy is conventional use of fossil fuels
then China and India's economic growth will cause catastophic global
climate change (GCC). Economists see two solutions to GCC: carbon
sequestration (remove and lock up the CO2 from combustion of fossil
fuels) or new technology of energy generation (fusion? fuel cells?
solar/hydrogen-cells). &nbsp;Economists focus on the possibility of
harnessing market forces to tackle the challenge of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions; to do so, economists want to see a price put on carbon,
through either cap and trade (just started in California) or a tax on
carbon. &nbsp;So far, opposition from producers and consumers of fossil
fuels has prevented progress in pricing carbon. (If interested, google
"CFC Montreal Protocol" to see a case of successful international
co-operation to prevent catastrophic ozone
depletion (and note the role of&nbsp;corporations who were looking for
to&nbsp;market substitutes for CFCs).<br><br>More
generally for an optimist view, we see&nbsp;possibilities for
technological change to give&nbsp;us economic growth with improvements
to our environment (PPF optional).</body></html>

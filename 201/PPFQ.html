a PPF model with manufacturing (M) versus services (S). &nbsp;Using PPF
models, describe how Michigan's production now would compare to
Michigan's production in the 1960s. Use rays from the origin to
describe how production has changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Consider a PPF

describe how Mt Pleasant's production compares to Midland's.&nbsp;Use rays from the origin to describe how
production differs.</p><br><i><b>T/F/O ? (credit for explanation only):</b></i> "If an economy is operating

produced using labor and land; clothing is produced using labor and
capital. Suppose the economy expands geographically, doubling the

signs a peace treaty and ends a war.

<p>Draw a PPF model to show an economy's trade-off between automobiles and other 
goods. Use the model to illustrate what would happen if the government outlawed 
the use of automobiles in cities. &nbsp;[A level: would production be efficient?]</p>
<p>Draw a PPF model to show an economy's trade-off between clothing and other 
goods. Use the model to illustrate what would happen if the government imposed a 50% tariff on clothing imports.</p>
<p>Initially, an economy produces 100 tanks and 900 tons of food, and production 
is efficient. Model this situation. Now suppose&nbsp;there is technological progress in tank production. Use a PPF 
model to explain whether the economy will be able to increase food production 
without reducing tank production.</p><p>Suppose

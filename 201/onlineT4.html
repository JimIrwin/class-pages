 <p><i><big>new items</i></big> <b> see Bb for practice for Tuesday's test</b> <p>
 watch here for new items, which be mmoved below in the order that the material is covered for continuing to learn, online.
For convenience, I'll be putting all the notes and TTQs into <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0" target="_blank">this folder</a> so you don't have 
to click through a bunch of links.</p>
<p>For Tuesday's test (3/31) lecture notes from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sglcaxhz9eg0hx4/201classes15-16.pdf?dl=0">Classes 15 and 16</a>.
 And notes for 
 <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0"> TTQ1</a> and 
 <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8c5qw473ukcgr3x/TTQ2notes.pdf?dl=0">TTQ2</a>.

<p>Recall, for online learining, it is "teaching to the test," with a series on online learning items, each organized around a TTQ. When you try writing an 
answer to a TTQ, please consider posting it to our 	<a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>.

<h4>TTQ &num; 1</h4>
<p>Our <a href="TTQ1.pdf" target="_blank">first TTQ</a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, we have our first online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKW460opQJY8aIexrq_Gf7O-Lluellrek" target="_blank">"Output, real and nominal"</a>. 
In this series of videos, we explore output comparisons in a 2-good model. 
And here are notes for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lzs95wevyao43os/AABse3iqCI_DjdMjo1yF9b-oa?dl=0">TTQ1</a> </p> 
<p>BTW There are many other UTube videos that <i>almost</i> cover the appropriate material -- but they use the term "GDP" 
when they are actually talking about "output" (recall that "output" (y) is the concept of total production of final goods, which we can
calculate in our simple models; GDP is a real-world measurement of output, which we can google but which we cannot calculate. 
We cover GDP in the second half of Topic 4). If you can remember to replace the word "GDP" with the word "output," then you might 
find the following videos helpful:<br>	
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfInod6G3TY">How to Calculate Nominal GDP and Real GDP</a> (careful, because this guy uses the word
"output" where we would say "production"; e.g. "output of 100 guitars" in 2015). 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me8_uwk2m-Y">Calculating Nominal and Real GDP</a>; &nbsp;&nbsp;
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2t3Cfrznu0">Nominal versus Real GDP</a>.   
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNfNZ1mIGRE">Real GDP and the GDP deflator</a> includes some material that we will cover later,
 as it introduces the concept of a price index (the "GDP deflator" is the name of the price index for GDP).
<p>If you do find something worthwhile there, please use our <a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>
to tell classmates.</p>

<h4>TTQ &num; 2</h4>
<p>Our <a href="TTQ2.pdf" target="_blank">second TTQ</a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, 
 we have our second online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tohRGhX04kA&list=PLKW460opQJY_GdmMsFwFCgUW6pnZyCHAM" target="_blank">"Real Output -- INP"</a>. 
In this two-part series, we find a problem comparing outputs when inflation is not pure 
 (when price of different goods grow at different rates, so that relative prices change).
And here are notes for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8c5qw473ukcgr3x/TTQ2notes.pdf?dl=0">TTQ2</a>. </p> 
 <p>TTQs &num; 1 and 2 are part of Topic 4; see the main page for <a href="201/TopicOutput.html" target="_blank">Topic 4</a> <b><i>Key Concepts</i></b> and
<a href="201/Topic4Q.html" target="_blank">Materials for Practice or Review</a>.

<p>For now, we are "teaching to the test" with a series on online learning items, each organized around a TTQ. When you try writing an 
answer to a TTQ, please consider posting it to our 	<a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>.
<h4>TTQ &num; 1</h4>
<p>Our <a href="TTQ1.pdf" target="_blank">first TTQ</a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, we have our first online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKW460opQJY8aIexrq_Gf7O-Lluellrek" target="_blank">"Output, real and nominal"</a>. 
In this series of videos, we explore output comparisons in a 2-good model.</p> 
<p>BTW There are many other UTube videos that <i>almost</i> cover the appropriate material -- but they use the term "GDP" 
when they are actually talking about "output" (recall that "output" (y) is the concept of total production of final goods, which we can
calculate in our simple models; GDP is a real-world measurement of output, which we can google but which we cannot calculate. 
We cover GDP in the second half of Topic 4). If you can remember to replace the word "GDP" with the word "output," then you might 
find the following videos helpful:<br>	
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfInod6G3TY">How to Calculate Nominal GDP and Real GDP</a>; careful, because this guy uses the word
"output" where we would say "production" (as in, production of 100 guitars in 2015). 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me8_uwk2m-Y">Calculating Nominal and Real GDP</a>; &nbsp;&nbsp;
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2t3Cfrznu0">Nominal versus Real GDP</a>.   
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNfNZ1mIGRE">Real GDP and the GDP deflator</a> includes some material that we will cover later,
 as it introduces the concept of a price index (the "GDP deflator" is the name of the price index for GDP).
<p>If you do find something worthwhile there, please use our <a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>
to tell classmates.</p>
<p>TTQ &num; 1 is part of Topic 4; see the main page for <a href="201/TopicOutput.html" target="_blank">Topic 4</a> <b><i>Key Concepts</i></b> and

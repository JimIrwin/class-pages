<p>For now, we are "teaching to the test" with a series on online learning items, each organized around a TTQ. When you try writing an 
answer to a TTQ, please consider posting it to our 	<a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco201/home" target="_blank">Piazza for ECO 201</a>.
<h4>TTQ &num; 1</h4>
<p>Our <a href="TTQ1.pdf" target="_blank">first TTQ</a>. To learn how to answer this TTQ, we have our first online learning item,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKW460opQJY8aIexrq_Gf7O-Lluellrek" target="_blank">"Output, real and nominal"</a>. 
In this series of videos, we explore output comparisons in a 2-good model.</p> 
<p>There are many other UTube video that <i>almost<i/> cover the appropriate material -- but in all of them, they use the term "GDP" 
	when they are actually talking about "output".  If you can remember to replace the word "GDP" with the word "output," 
	then you might find one	of the following videos helpful:<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfInod6G3TY">How to Calculate Nominal GDP and Real GDP</a>.Careful, because this guy uses the word
	"output" where we would say "production" (as in, production of 100 guitars in 2015).

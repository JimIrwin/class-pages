<p><font size="2">In your "<span style="font-weight: bold;">selection</span>"&nbsp;
assignment, you earn 3 points by getting approved for a scholarly
article (or book chapter)&nbsp; that covers some&nbsp;topic or issue in
US economic history&nbsp;(1492-2015), based on your interests. Your
approved reading can be either an article in a scholarly journal (such
as&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Journal of Economic History&nbsp;</span> or&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">American Historical Review</span>)
&nbsp;or &nbsp;one or more chapters from a scholarly book;&nbsp;the
reading must fall under the heading of US economic history. &nbsp;To
complete the selection assigment, you email Prof. Irwin requesting a
specific reading, with&nbsp;a brief explanation of what the article
covers and why you chose it. Check the bibliographys (references) of
the readings on the Active Course Outline. For a broader range of
topics,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank"> Google scholar</a> will&nbsp;useful, and more general web searches might also work; CMU's library may have other useful resources.</font></p><font size="2">In the one page summary the goal is to provide an
in-depth description of your reading, providing lots of information
about what the piece is about (issues, evidence, methods, findings).&nbsp;
The challenge here is to be informative despite the short space.&nbsp;
In part you will be demonstrating that you did the reading, but
mostly you will be producing valuable information: a one page guide
to your reading.&nbsp; Of course the summary will be in your own
words except for quotations. The one page limit is <b>strict, </b>the
format is flexible (complete sentences are required, paragraph
structure recommended).</font>
<p><font size="2">In the 5-6 page essay the goal is to draw out
connections between the reading and concepts and issues and topics
that we cover in ECO 310.&nbsp; In part, you will be demonstrating
that the essay is your own product (it would be difficult to buy an
internet essay that discussed both the reading and our class!), but
mostly you will be producing a valuable good: your reflections on
connections between the reading and the course.&nbsp; The 6 page
limitation is not strict; it is ok if you need more space to develop
your insights (but unnecessary length would pull down the score).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">* <i>Academic honesty issues: 1) DISCLOSURE: let me
know if you are covering the reading for another class so we can
avoid double-counting.&nbsp; 2) PLAIGARISM: be careful to use
quotation marks when you use other people's writing and to use
references for ideas and facts (parenthetical or footnote or
endnote).&nbsp; Avoid paraphrasing; use quotations instead.</i></font></p><br></body></html>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1) GR minor compared to GD.   GDP
declines 5% 2007-2009 and 30% 1929-33; Unemployment peaks at 10% in
2009 and 25% in 1933 (Bordo, p. 2 &amp; <a target="_blank" href="BordoF1&amp;2.pdf">figures
1&amp;2</a>)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">2) Key contrast was the behavior of the money supply: <a href="MoneyGRGD.pdf" target="_blank">GD vs GR</a></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">3)
Lessons from the GD prevented
another one. In short, in the early 1930s the Fed&nbsp;allowed banking
panics to collapse the monetary system. In 2008-09 the Fed acted
aggressively to keep the monetary and financial systems from collapsing.</p>

Wall  Street  boom  beginning  in  early  1928  led  to  the downturn
which began in August 1929 followed by the Stock Market crash in
October. However there is considerable evidence to refute the view
that the Wall Street Crash caused the Great Depression.

The real problem arose with a series of banking crises that began in
October 1930 and ended with the Banking Holiday of March 1933. Milton
Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1963) posited that the panics by reducing
the deposit currency and deposit reserve ratios reduced the money
multiplier and hence the money supply ...  The  panics  which  began 
in  1930  and  worsened  in  1931  when  it  became  global, 
reflected  a contagion  of  fear  as  the  public  converted  their 
deposits  into  currency  i.e.  they  hoarded  currency.  The public
staged a series of runs on the banking system leading to  massive
bank suspensions. In modern terms  there  was  a  big liquidity 
shock.  The  collapse  of  the  money  supply  led  to  a  decline 
in  nominal spending and, in the face of sticky wages a decline in
employment and output.

There is considerable debate over whether the clusters of bank
failures in the early 1930s were really  driven  by  contagious 
liquidity  shocks  as  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1963)  argued,  or 
<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">whether  the bank failures reflected an endogenous response to the
downturn that was caused by other non monetary forces</span>, as posited by
Peter Temin (1976) and recently by Charles Calomiris and Joseph Mason
(2006).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 2in; text-indent: 0.26in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
The upshot of the banking panics ... is that they represented a major
Fed policy failure. The Fed which was founded in 1913 in large part
to be a lender of last resort to the banking system failed in its
duty. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">The Fed could have prevented the Great Contraction by using
expansionary open market policy, a tool which was familiar to Fed
officials.</span>

(e.g. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers) which
had expanded after the repeal in 1999 of the Depression era Glass
Steagall act which had separated investment banking from commercial
banking, had much more leverage than traditional banks and were much
more prone to risk. When the crisis hit they were forced to engage in
major deleveraging involving a fire sale of assets into a falling
market. This lowered the value of their assets and those of other
institutions. A similar negative feedback loop had occurred in the
1930s. ... The repo crisis continued through 2008 and then morphed
into an investment/universal bank crisis after the failure of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008.

The crisis led to a credit crunch which led to a serious recession.</span>
The effects of the credit crisis can be seen in the spike of the
quality spread in the fall of 2008. It looks similar to what happened
in 1931 (Figure  19).  However  the  recent  crisis  was  not  a 
contagious  banking  panic.  There  was  no  collapse  in money
supply brought about by the collapse of the deposit currency ratio as
had occurred in the 1930s. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">M2  didn’t  collapse.</span>  Indeed  it 
rose,  reflecting  expansionary  monetary  policy  (Figure  20).  The
 deposit currency ratio rose (Figure 21). There was no run on the
commercial banks because depositors knew that their deposits were
protected by federal deposit insurance which had been introduced in
1934 in reaction to the bank runs of the 1930s. The deposit reserve
ratio declined reflecting an expansionary monetary policy induced
increase in the banks excess reserves rather than a scramble for
liquidity as had occurred in  the  1930s  (Figure  22).  The  money 
multiplier  declined  in  the  recent  crisis  (Figure  23) 
reflecting  a massive expansion in the monetary base (Figure 24) seen
in the Fed’s doubling of its balance sheet in 2008. Moreover
although a few banks failed between 2007-2010 the numbers of failures
and the size of the losses were small relative to the 1930s. Thus the
recent financial crisis was not driven by a Friedman and Schwartz
type banking panic. But there was a panic in the shadow banking
system and it was driven more by insolvency than by contagious
illiquidity considerations.  ... the credit market, confronted by
financial firms whose portfolios were filled with securities of
uncertain value, derivatives that were so complex the art of pricing
them had not been mastered, was plagued by the inability to determine
which firms were solvent and which were not. Lenders were unwilling
to extend loans when they couldn’t be sure that a borrower  was
 credit  worthy.  This  was  a  serious  shortcoming  of  the 
securitization  process  that  was responsible for the paralysis of
the credit market.

p 7:  Thus the policy response of aggressive monetary policy learned
from the experience of the Great Depression greatly helped attenuate
the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy. But the
sources of  systemic  risk  differed  considerably  between  the  two
 episodes:  a  contagious  banking  panic  then,  an insolvency
driven counterparty risk problem recently.</p>

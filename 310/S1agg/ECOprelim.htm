<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>-- orientation to economics, </b>
using an old principles test question: </P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Which is the most fundamental (or 
relevant) to the study of economics?&nbsp; a. inflation;&nbsp; b. unemployment;&nbsp; 
c. money; d. scarcity;&nbsp; e. the stock market.</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Answer, scarcity.&nbsp; Something is scarce if 
people want more than is freely available.&nbsp; Economics focuses on scarcity 
as the main obstacle to human welfare (well-being). </P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">"I do not mean to enter into a philosophical discussion of&nbsp; what 
constitutes the proper happiness of man, but shall merely consider two 
universally acknowledged ingredients, health, and the command of the necessaries 
and conveniences of life."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Malthus, Chap. 16;

<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Welfare :&nbsp; well-being, or 
happiness.&nbsp; In economics we focus on people's material well-being, as 
affected by their access to the goods that the economy produces. Economists 
recognize that people's welfare is affected by many other factors beyond the 
goods they get (for example relationships and health), but they abstract from 
psychological and spiritual and artistic issues and focus on materialistic 
factors affecting welfare.</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Economics is the social science that 
studies the goal of welfare in relation to the problem of scarcity.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Macroeconomics (ECO 201/204) is about 
the economy as a whole, e.g. long run economic growth and short-run recessions 
and unemployment.</P>
<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Microeconomics (ECO 202/203) looks at 
individual choices; in our principles course, we usually look at choices in the context of a market. </P>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">ECO 310 starts with a macro 
perspective, with Aggregate Economic History.&nbsp; When we switch to a 
historical perspective we will use more microeconomics.</p>

show for incomes before 1800?
<br>Incomes fluctuating around subsistence, in what Clark calls the "Malthusian Trap." See the Clark reading (optional) for details. 
But in short, the story is that population growth trapped societies at a bare subsistence. Whenever living conditions improved, population expanded, 
pushing incomes back down to subsistence. In the Malthusian Trap economy, increases in production possibilities end up supporting larger populations at subsistence, 
instead of improving the living conditions of the existing population.
<br><br>The Malthusian model has two simple propositions.
<br>(1) Growth of population reduces production per person, because population growth causes resources per person to decline.
<br>(2) Population grows when living conditions are better than subsistence (humans are like other animals, who simply eat and breed based on their environment).
<br> In the Malthusian model, improvements in technology will raise per capita output temporarily, but the improved living conditions cause
population to grow, so living conditions decline back to subsistence.</font></font></small></body></html>

<P>From Alik Shahadah's  &quot;<A HREF="http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/africanrace.html">Defining
African Identity Today</A>&quot; (12-2009)</P>
<P>	There is no such thing as a trans-historical African identity. 
Therefore, in Africa's ancient history the term 'African' as an
identity would have had no meaning; people defined themselves as
members of kingdoms, religions, and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>      ... With greater interaction with non-Africans, Arabs and
later Europeans, then this sense or necessity of a centralized
globalized African identity started to take root; with its
&quot;ethnogenisis&quot; especially in the Diaspora.

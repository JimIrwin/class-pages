Migration was mostly of African slaves for the first 3 centuries of
European expansion into the New World.  Only after 1840 do Europeans
exceed Africans in terms of numbers of migrants to the Western
Hemisphere (Eltis, 1983).  By the second 1/2 of the 19th C the
numbers of migrants from Asia is also huge, the second wave of
"contract labor" or indentured servitude.</font></p>

Slaves were people owned by other people,  bought and sold as if they
were livestock.  It is now almost an extinct institution, but it was
once very very common in most of world.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a>
 Some scholars estimate that most people under the Roman Empire were
slaves.  New World slavery continued until the 1880's (Brazil). The
trade into the US ended in 1808, and slavery in the US was abolished
1865. The British slave trade ended in the 1820's, with abolition of
slavery in British colonies (e.g. Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica) in the
1830's.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><font size="2">2
Slaves were imported into the New World mostly to produce <b>SUGAR</b>
-- the crop that was perhaps the oil of the time.  Sugar was produced
on very large plantations (100-500 slaves), mostly on Caribbean
Islands and in parts of Brazil.  Free people refused to work the
plantations, but slaves were forced to. Probably 2/3 of slaves were
brought over for sugar production. Most of the rest were imported for
mining (gold, silver, and diamonds), but also for indigo, tobacco,
coffee, and rice.  <b>COTTON was not important</b> until much later
(and mostly after US banned the trade (1808)).</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><font size="2">3 The
slave trade was one side of the "triangular trade" of the
mercantilist nation states.  The triangle had (1) European slave
traders buying  slaves on the West coast of Africa,  paying with
manufactured products (guns, knives, tools, clothing, liquor, sugar);
 (2) they took the slaves to the New World, and sold them to sugar
planters and others;  who paid with their receipts from (3) selling
sugar and other slave-produced crops or minerals in Europe.  Traders
and trading companies were mostly organized and militarily protected
by the Portuguese, English, French, and Dutch nation states; American
colonists in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston also participated in
the trade (until 1807).  Europeans traded<a href="SlaveryInWestAfrica.pdf"> for slaves with kingdoms on
the west coast of Africa</a>. Coastal kingdoms engaged in warfare and
raiding to capture and enslave people of inland societies.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a>
The newly enslaved endured a forced marched to the coast to be sold
to the European traders. The impact of enslavement and transport to
the coast was horrific, with at least 40 million people killed to
"produce" some 13 million people for export (Klein, p. 34
in Drescher &amp; Engerman 1998).</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><font size="2">4.
About<b> </b><span style="font-weight: normal;">2/3</span> of the
slaves in the transatlantic trade were men; there were very few
children (children sold for less but took up almost as much room as
adults, and they tended to die more).</font></p>



<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><font size="2">5. Over
12 million slaves landed in the Americas in the period 1500-1880.  A
similar number were taken North through the Sahara desert from Africa
in a longer span of time (about 1400-1900).  Many more left Africa
... at least 1/10 of those leaving died in the "middle passage"
of enslavement, between Africa and America. &nbsp;Probably
some 14 million left Africa bound for the New World.  Many many more had
been enslaved but died before leaving Africa (probably in the range of 30 to 50
million; but such deaths are difficult to distinguish for mortality associated with slave-raiding and warfare ).&nbsp;</font><br><br>

	  Eltis (1993, p. 1400) recently asked: " the question is not
	why slavery per se but rather which  groups  are  considered 
	eligible  for  enslavement  ... what separates outsiders-those  who
	are eligible for enslavement-from  insiders, who are not. Thus 
	Nathan Huggins  has answered the often-asked question of how
	Africans could enslave other Africans and sell them into the slave
	trade with the astute response that the enslavers did not see
	themselves or their victims as Africans." In short, Africa
	included a wide range of societies, with people who did not identify
	themselves as <a href="african.html">African</a> as opposed to
	European. Arguably, the development of <a href="EuroIdentit.pdf">European
	identity</a> helps explain why people living in Europe were not
	enslaved to work in the mercantilist empires. On this point, see

<p> 1845 <b>390 Ksm</b> added by<a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/florida">the Annexation of Texas (and most of New Mexico).
Much interesting history here, such as
<a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/florida">The US-Mexican War, Forgotten Foes</a> (which connects to our discussions of 
Amerindian populations and the N-S reversal.</p>

<p>Microeconomics of slavery: Profitability and Productivity</p>
</font>
</b><p><b>Profitability</b>?</p>
<p>For many years historians discussed whether a planter buying slaves made as 
much money as he could have by buying alternative "investments" (such as 
government bonds). Most famously, the historian Ulrich B. Philips pointed to 
rising slave prices and falling cotton prices in the decades before the Civil 
War to argue that southern slaveowners were caught in a profit squeeze. His 
explanation was that benevolent masters were sacrificing their wealth to keep 
the slaves on the plantations and protect the slaves and southern society from 
race war and genocide.&nbsp; We now understand that both the rise of slave 
prices and the decline of cotton prices were a result of increasing productivity 
of slaves as the cotton kingdom expanded westward.</p>
<p>Profitability is no longer discussed much: economists have clarified that 
slave prices were determined in the markets of the South, so the profitability 
question is simply whether slave prices reflected slaves' earnings (like any 
other "capital" asset), or whether other factors like prestige affected slave 
prices.&nbsp; Economists have found lots of evidence that slave prices were 
determined by slave productivity and no indications that prestige-seekers 
affected slave price.&nbsp; The question now is why slave prices were so high on 
the eve of the Civil War. Perhaps slaveowners were extremely confident that 
slavery would not be ending any time soon, but maybe there was some sort of 
bubble in late antebellum slave markets.</p>

<p><b>The Productivity of Slavery</b></p>
<p>After Engerman (1967) discovered that the South in 1860 was not as
poor as people had thought, he and Fogel started exploring the
comparative productivity of agriculture in the North and South on the
eve of the Civil War. First they drew on the 1860 censuses to measure
agricultural outputs and inputs in the North and South and compare TFPs
(total factor productivities).&nbsp; Surprisingly, they found that
Southern agriculture produced 40% more output from a given amount of
labor, capital and land (the TFP of southern agriculture was 140% of
the TFP of northern agriculture).&nbsp; Critics argued that they were
simply measuring the effects of the South's climate
advantage,&nbsp;which enabled&nbsp;production of cotton (the most
lucrative crop of 19th C US agriculture).&nbsp; Fogel and Engerman
(F&amp;E) then drew on the Parker-Gallman sample of southern farms
(from the US census manuscripts) to measure outputs and inputs of
different sizes of farms/plantations within the South in 1860.</p>
<p>There has been a huge volume of work on this topic, but we can summarize 
F&amp;E's results in the following table:</p>

<p>source: F&amp;E, <i>AER, </i>1977. </p>
<p>The TFP results are saying that plantations with 16 to 50 slaves were the 
most productive operations: the number 145 is saying that a given amount of 
labor, capital, and land used on a plantation (16-50 slaves) would produce 145% 
as much output as it would have produced if used on a slaveless farm in the 
South. Scholars continue to argue about why the slave-labor farms were more 
productive than free-labor farms.&nbsp; My early work (Irwin 1988, 1994) 
focussed on the two main explanations: the slave-labor hypothesis and the 
plantation-efficiency hypothesis. The slave-labor hypothesis (Wright (1978) and 
Ransom and Sutch (1977)) says that slaves were forced to work more hours than 
free people chose to work, so slave-labor farms had more output because they had 
more input.&nbsp; The plantation-efficiency hypothesis (Fogel and Engerman, 1974 
and later) says that plantations were more productive than smaller units 
(economies of scale), because slaves in gangs could be forced to work faster and 
harder than workers on smaller units, and because centralized living 
arrangements reduced the costs of food and child-care and freed up female labor 
for field work.&nbsp; Either way, slavery is seen here as a system that boosted 
the South's per capita GDP, compared to what a free-labor economy would have 
produced.</p>
<p>My research on Virginia in 1850-1860 <i>(EEH 1988),</i> and on the South as a 
whole from 1860-80 <i>(EEH 1994) </i>presents evidence and test to make a case for the 
plantation-efficiency story and against the slave-labor hypothesis. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly -- in view of the&nbsp;TFP evidence -- southern per capita GDP 
declined after emancipation. The debate is over why and how.&nbsp; The 
slave-labor hypothesis says that slaves had been forced to work more, and that 
when freed they reduced their labor supply to be like free worker. It says the 
key factor to explain the decline of southern per capita GDP from 1860 to 1880 
was the number of people who were freed from slave-labor.&nbsp; The 
plantation-efficiency hypothesis says that it was the slaves on plantations who 
were forced to work more productively than free people would. It says the key 
factor to explain the decline of southern per capita GDP from 1860 to 1880 was 
the number of people who were freed from plantation-slavery.&nbsp; Irwin (1994 EEH) 
uses econometrics to compare two types of areas in the South: (1) areas with 
plantation slavery and (2) areas with non-plantation slavery.&nbsp; It shows 
that production <i>increased </i>&nbsp;from 1860 to 1880 in the areas with 
non-plantation slavery and decreased in the plantations areas. Those results are&nbsp; 
support for the plantation-efficiency hypothesis and against the slave-labor 
hypothesis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The current puzzle:&nbsp; the "<b>dreadful 
childhood</b>" of American slaves (according to Steckel*)&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1974 American slavery became easier to understand. Fogel and Engerman's <i>
Time on the Cross</i> showed that southern slaveowners had a hard-working and 
fecund labor force. Genovese's <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll</i> showed why the enslaved 
people worked hard and raised children: they made the most of a bad situation, 
carving out space of their own to&nbsp; nurture family, faith, and hope. </p>
<p>In 1986 American slavery became more difficult to understand. In a series of 
powerful papers Richard Steckel argued that southern slaves had "a dreadful 
childhood," suffering infant and child mortality rates that were worse than 
those typical of urban slums in the third world in the 20th Century. </p>
<p>Working from data on heights of slave children from shipping records, Steckel inferred that 
slaves had very low birth-weights and correspondingly high infant mortality. 
Working from plantation records on birth and deaths, Steckel estimated 
childhood mortality rates for slaves that were about double those of free children of the time. 
In Steckel's description, slave infants and children were malnourished and 
subject to high mortality until they joined the labor force, when the material 
conditions of life improved dramatically. Once in the labor force, slaves were 
amply fed, and they largely recovered from their "dreadful childhood," growing 
up to become the strong and hard-working adults familiar in <i>Time on the 
Cross.</i> </p>
<p>Steckel's results and speculations are fascinating and important, with huge 
implications for our understanding of slavery. If nothing else, they serve to 
challenge two guiding themes in the past 4&nbsp; decades of historical research 
and interpretation (e.g. Blassingame, Gutman, Harding, Stampp, others): (1) the 
vitality and strength of the black family under slavery, and (2) agency -- the 
slaves' success in carving out room of their own and limiting the masters' 
attempts to dominate and dictate every facet of slave life. Those two themes 
need reconsideration if in truth southern masters imposed, and southern slaves 
accepted, a regime featuring a childhood of deprivation, neglect, and death; and 
an adulthood of hard-work fueled by abundant rations. </p>
<p>Steckel's findings have tended to be&nbsp;accepted by economic historians. 
However, the empirical basis for his view of slave childhood is narrow enough 
that additional research promises to be valuable. Steckel's (1986; <i>EEH</i>) 
result on slave infant mortality is based on his analysis of the heights of 
slave children from manifests of ships engaged in the coastwise trade in the 
antebellum period. His results on childhood mortality are estimated from records 
of 11 large plantations. It remains to be seen if the mortality experiences 
recorded there were typical of the southern slave population. In any case, more 
evidence, and more types of evidence, are desirable, because of both the 
importance of Steckel's findings and the narrowness of his evidence.</p>

astonishingly small and malnourished while working slaves were remarkably well 
fed." </p>

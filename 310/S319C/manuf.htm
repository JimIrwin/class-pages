<title>US Manufacturing</title>

<p><b>The Rise of Manufacturing</b></p>
<p>There were several&nbsp; &quot;distinctive&quot; features of 19th Century US 
manufacturing, compared to developments in Europe (esp. England, also France &amp; 
Germany).</p>
<p>As Cain &amp; Hughes (2003) put it in their textbook, the &quot;American System&quot; 
featured&nbsp; interchangeable parts, with methods that saved on labor 
(especially skilled labor), relying more on capital and natural resources.</p>
<p>The top industries (1860) were resource-related:&nbsp; cotton goods, lumber, 
boots&amp;shoes, flour &amp; corn meal,&nbsp; men's clothing, and iron (followed by 
machinery, woolens, carriages &amp; wagons, leather goods).</p>
<p>Until after the Civil War, manufacturing was fairly small-scale and did not 
use power-driven machinery, except for the cotton mills of New England.&nbsp; 
And in that case, power was from water (mills); steam engines powering large 
scale factories did not emerge until the last 1/4 of the 19th C. </p>
<p>Sokoloff's Ph.D. research found that the transition from craftsmen working in 
shops to small-scale factories resulted in large productivity gains.&nbsp; The 
debate now is whether the early factory system was a pure gain to all involved.&nbsp; 
The pure gain story is that the factory system enabled workers to get more 
produced from the same time and effort (with less wasted time, and more 
co-ordination of activities). An alternative story sees the factory as a 
mechanism that enabled bosses to force workers to work more (more time and/or 
more effort resulting in more production, but at a cost to worker welfare). </p>
<p>After the Civil War we see the rise of large-scale coal/steam-powered 
industries. This is evident, in part, from the following data on urban 
population and steel production:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
% urban</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
2500+&nbsp;&nbsp; 100K+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steel production</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1790&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
0 </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1860&nbsp; 19.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1870=77) </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1910&nbsp; 45.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
22.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
28,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(source: oops -- I don't have the source handy!)</p>
<p>Seen another way, Cain &amp; Hughes (2003, pp. 330-331) report that 1910 iron &amp; 
steel production was 25 times greater than in 1860 (while food and textiles each 
were just 4-6 times greater).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distinctive US manufacturing :</p>
<p>(1) used capital and unskilled labor to replace skilled labor; a key example 
is early mass production using interchangeable parts of guns in the US, compared 
to the fine custom-made guns in England; also: early assembly lines in New 
England, using women and kids (1810s-1830s) and then immigrants (1830s on). </p>
<p>(2) relied on what Europeans called &quot;wasteful&quot; techniques; techniques that 
used lots of raw materials (e.g. high-pressure steam engine burns more coal than 
low-pressure; saw mills that wasted, cotton mills that wasted raw cotton) 
compared to methods in Europe.</p>
<p>(3) output: in the US the final products were simpler &amp; lower priced than in 
Europe.&nbsp; Early on, production was for the mass market (guns, clothes, 
shoes, etc).&nbsp; The issue:&nbsp; was it low-cost? (for the quality) or was it 
&quot;cheap&quot; (i.e. low-quality).</p>

<p><i>Some Details, if interested:&nbsp; </i>(from Martin Lipton, &quot;<a href="http://osgoode.yorku.ca/media2.nsf/58912001c091cdc8852569300055bbf9/1e37719232517fd0852571ef00701385/$file/merger%20waves_toronto_lipton.pdf">Merger 
Waves in the 19th , 20th and 21st Centuries</a>,&quot; 2006)</p>
<p>First Period – 1893 to 1904. This was the time of the major horizontal 
mergers creating the principal steel, telephone, oil, mining, railroad and other 
giants of the basic manufacturing and transportation industries in the U.S. The 
Panics of 1904 and 1907, a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1904 making the 
recently enacted antitrust laws applicable to horizontal mergers, and then the 
First World War are pointed to as the causes of the end of the first wave, which 
some view as continuing beyond 1904. </p>
<p>Second Period – 1919 to 1929. This period saw further consolidation in the 
industries that were the subject of the first wave and a very significant 
increase in vertical integration. The major automobile manufacturers emerged in 
this period. Ford, for example, was integrated from the finished car back 
through steel mills, railroads and ore boats to the iron and coal mines. The 
1929 Crash and the Great Depression ended this wave</p>
<p>Third Period – 1955 to 1969-73. This was the period in which the conglomerate 
concept took hold of American management. Major conglomerates like IT&amp;T (Harold 
Geneen), LTV (Jimmy Ling), Teledyne (Henry Singleton) and Litton (Tex Thornton) 
were created. Messrs. Geneen, Ling, Singleton and Thornton were viewed as 
visionaries and heroes of the new concept of business organization. Many major 
established companies accepted the concept and diversified into new industries 
and areas. The conglomerate stocks crashed in 1969-70 and the diversified 
companies never achieved the benefits thought to be derived from 
diversification. </p>
<p>Fourth Period – 1974-80 to 1989. Generally referred to as the merger wave, or 
takeover wave, of the 1980s and frequently said to be the period from 1984 to 
1989. However, its antecedents reach back to 1974 when the first major-company 
hostile bid was made by Morgan Stanley on behalf of Inco (the same Inco that has 
been involved in the four-way takeover struggle that has now ended with its 
takeover by Vale) seeking to take over ESB. This successful hostile bid opened 
the door for the major investment banks to make hostile takeover bids on behalf 
of raiders. In addition to hostile bids, this period was noted for junk bond 
financing and steadily increasing volume and size of LBOs. In Europe in the 
latter half of the 1980s companies sought to prepare for the Common Market 
through cross-border horizontal mergers. In the U.S. this was the period that 
saw corporate raiders like Boone Pickens run rampant with two-tier, 
front-end-loaded, boot-strap, bust-up, junk-bond, hostile tender offers until 
the playing field was leveled by the poison pill in the mid-1980s. However, even 
after the poison pill, merger activity increased through the latter part of the 
1980s, pausing for only a few months after the October 1987 stock market crash. 
It ended in 1989-90 with the $25 billion RJR Nabisco LBO and the collapse of the 
junk bond market, along with the collapse of the savings and loan banks and the 
serious loan portfolio and capital problems of the commercial banks.</p>

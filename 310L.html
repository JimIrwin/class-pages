<p><font size="4"><i><b>Current matters ...</b></i></font> &nbsp; <p>We're working on "continuing to learn", online; 
if we are lucky, we will complete Part 3 of the course (The Long 19th Century).
<p>For online learning, we are moving on from Exam #1. In addition to the online materials for Topic 2, 
Tuesday's test will also cover our last three class meetings (material not covered by Exam 1). 
The test on Tuesday starts with the Regional Wealth Comparisons from the end of Class 13 (Tues Feb 25), 
and it will cover Classes 14 and 15 (the week before Spring Break). Testing will be of the usual form of our in-class tests, with fill-in-the-blanks,
	concept matching, and multiple choice. <b>We will no longer use essays for testing.</b>.
To help students prepare for the test, I have re-worked my personal lecture notes into 
	<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c88jdr22ptucrfn/C14-16online.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> notes for 13-16.</a>.
These lead into the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2eqhcdxn58seadg/Land2-2take2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Topic 2.0-2.2 notes</a>
that were posted previously. By Thursday (3/26), I will finish adding materials for Topic 2 (Land). Then you will have access to all
materials for next Tuesday's test. I also hope to start adding materials for Topic 3 (The Transportation Revolution), 
	so students can work ahead.  
<b>Note</b> the test will also cover the required readings (*) from Topics 1 and 2 of 
<a href="310/Long19C.html" target="_blank">The Long 19th Century</a>
<p>As always, students are encouraged to offer responses (questions, comments and suggestions) to Topic 2 notes using  our Piazza
(especially if you are trying to improve your March 11 grade).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I have decided against any essay-writing for testing in the online learning portion of the course. For your learning,
in each Topic I encourage you to find one or two sub-topics that you would have written about, had our class carried on as planned.
But all testing will be designed to measure the extent to which you worked on and are familiar with course content (like our in-class tests in the first half).	
Students seeking to improve their grade will need to take the tests in a narrow window of time; those seeking to maintain a grade will have 
several days (or more) in which to perform at a passing level in a test.</p>

<p><i><b>Done ...</b></p>
<p> ... later today I expect to add notes for 2.3, which will complete the notes for Topic 2. Starting
Thursday (CHANGED TO TUESDAY -- SEE Bb and emails) there will be a brief online test covering the notes and the required readings (*) on the Active Course Outline.
<small>You might want to compare the revised Topic 2 notes to 
	<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ty4ba8iz586w0ue/LandLecture.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> these</a> from 
	last week</small> 
<p><b><i>Exam Revisions are due by Tuesday March 24</b></i>, 
but don't hesistate to request an extension based on your circumstances.</p>
<br><br> 
	To get started, look over <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ty4ba8iz586w0ue/LandLecture.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> these notes</a> 
 on "Land" in the Long 19th Century (and be sure to refer to the Topic's required and optional readings as well). I hope 
interested students will offer responses (questions, comments and suggestions) to the Land notes on our Piazza.</p>

<i>Be sure to attend class to keep up with the course: all </i><i><u>official</u>announcements, deadlines, assignments etc.

Please use our course <a href="https://piazza.com/cmich/spring2020/eco310/home" target="_blank">Piazza</a> for questions 
that may be of interest to classmates, and for discussions related to the course (email me about other matters).

I ignore CMU-related email from non-CMICH email addresses (anybody could create a gmail account using your name).&nbsp;
See me if you want to correspond from a non-cmich address.

but don't hesistate to request an extension based on your circumstances.</p>
<p>We'll work on "continuing to learn", online. 
To get started, look over <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ty4ba8iz586w0ue/LandLecture.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> these notes</a> 
 on "Land" in the Long 19th Century (and be sure to refer to the Topic's required and optional readings as well). I hope 
interested students will offer responses (questions, comments and suggestions) to the Land notes on our Piazza.</p>
<p> BTW You can expect to write take-home exam essays on the topics of Part 3. For each topic, I encourage you to find one or two sub-topics that
you will write about (you'll find some guidance the notes I link here). <i>I still have to work out how we'll handle testing and grading, with the 
main challenge being how to offer ways to improve grades for folks who haven't been scoring well so far.</i></p>

<p>Our next graded testing (<s>3-2 Land and</s> 3-3 Tr Rev) will be Tuesday April 14 </p> 
	<p>The <a href="310/online.html">Active Outline for Online Learning</a> organizes materials 	
for "continuing to learn", online (hoping to complete Part 3 of the course (The Long 19th Century)). It includes links to
specific videos in Dr. Irwin's

<p> I hope students will review this notes and then sift through the Readings etc. for the topic. And then we could use the Piazza 
to identify concepts or issues of interest. In the absence of suggestions from students, I'll simply narrow down the transport revolution
to some specific material to study and be tested on ... :(   </p>
Maybe we'll want to try some office hours via Skype?
For now, contact me via <a href="mailto:irwin1jr@cmich.edu"><i>email</i></a>) or the Piazza</p>
There will be no graded testing on new material before Tuesday April 14 
<p>Moving forward, we'll use this <a href="310/online.html"><font size="5">Active Outline for Online Learning</font></a> to organize materials 	
for "continuing to learn", online (hoping to complete Part 3 of the course (The Long 19th Century)). 
For now, I will also leave the paragraphs below in view; after Tuesday's test, those paragraphs will be moved down
to the <a href="#Done"> "Done"</a> section.</p>
<p>For online learning, we are moving on from Exam 1, with our first test next Tuesday (refer to the email for details). 
In addition to the online materials for Topic 2, Tuesday's test will cover our last three class meetings (material not covered by Exam 1). 
The test will cover the Regional Wealth Comparisons from the end of Class 13 (Tues Feb 25), Classes 14 and 15 (the week before Spring Break), and the 
online materials to the end of Topic 2 (Land). Testing will be of the usual form of our in-class tests, with fill-in-the-blanks,
concept matching, and multiple choice.	<b>We will no longer use essays for testing.</b>.
<p>To help students prepare for the test, I have re-worked my personal lecture notes into 
	<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c88jdr22ptucrfn/C14-16online.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> notes for classes 13-16.</a>.
These lead into the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhr8x2le0aklcfn/3-2Land.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Topic 2 notes</a>. 
And topic 2 concludes with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxO3pHxMHWU" target="_blank">UTube video</a> I made,
using a PPF model to illustrate the effects of increasing the economy's land endowment (with the effects expected by 
both Ham &amp; Jeff). Understanding that model is optional for the purposes of online learning. <b>Note</b> the test will also cover the required readings (*) from Topics 1 and 2 of 
<a href="310/Long19C.html" target="_blank">The Long 19th Century</a>
<p>BTW, the new Topic 2 notes add <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t5dg32a8x7z0ibo/Land2-3.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> Section 2.3 notes</a> to the 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2eqhcdxn58seadg/Land2-2take2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Topic 2.0-2.2 notes</a>
	that were posted previously.</p> 
<p>Stay tuned for materials for Topic 3 (The Transportation Revolution), which will be added soon so students can work ahead
(testing on Topic 3 is likely to be Tues April 7). 
<p>As always, students are encouraged to offer responses (questions, comments and suggestions) to Topic 2 notes using  our Piazza
(especially if you are trying to improve your March 11 grade).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I have decided against any essay-writing for testing in the online learning portion of the course. For your learning,
in each Topic I encourage you to find one or two sub-topics that you would have written about, had our class carried on as planned.
But all testing will be designed to measure the extent to which you worked on and are familiar with course content (like our in-class tests in the first half).	
Students seeking to improve their grade will need to take the tests in a narrow window of time; those seeking to maintain a grade will have 
several days (or more) in which to perform at a passing level in a test.</p>


<p>There might be some more materials for Topic 2 (Land). Then you will have access to all
	materials for next Tuesday's test. </p>
<p> ... later today I expect to add notes for 2.3, which will complete the notes for Topic 2. Starting
Thursday (CHANGED TO TUESDAY -- SEE Bb and emails) there will be a brief online test covering the notes and the required readings (*) on the Active Course Outline.
<small>You might want to compare the revised Topic 2 notes to 
	<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ty4ba8iz586w0ue/LandLecture.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> these</a> from 
	last week</small> 
<p><b><i>Exam Revisions are due by Tuesday March 24</b></i>, 
but don't hesistate to request an extension based on your circumstances.</p>
<br><br> 
	To get started, look over <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ty4ba8iz586w0ue/LandLecture.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"> these notes</a> 
 on "Land" in the Long 19th Century (and be sure to refer to the Topic's required and optional readings as well). I hope 
interested students will offer responses (questions, comments and suggestions) to the Land notes on our Piazza.</p>

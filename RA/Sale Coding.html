sale, various&nbsp;combinations of
verbs may be used,&nbsp;e.g. in Albany:&nbsp; "grant bargain and
sell"&nbsp; &nbsp;or &nbsp;"sell convey
release and confirm" etc. &nbsp; &nbsp;]&nbsp;<br><br>sale.grant : for
Henrico in the 1850s, many deeds simply use the word "grant" without
the usual other words (bargain, sell,&nbsp;convey, etc.). &nbsp;<br>sale.gw
-- when the deed says "grant ... &nbsp;with general warranty" (and
other words like "bargain&nbsp;and sell" are not used. &nbsp;Many deeds
that "grant" land are deeds to "secure" some debt, but some are simply
sales --
read through the deed to identify it for coding of the deed variable as
"sale.grant" versus "secure" &nbsp;. &nbsp;<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="background-color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">FPtype</span>

many persons, record surnames only. &nbsp;If more than five surnames,

(or initial)
&nbsp;e.g. &nbsp;Anthony susan b &nbsp; &nbsp; King martin luther Jr
&nbsp; <br>Surnames start with a capital letter (upper case).&nbsp;<br><br>Periods are not used when coding names. A comma separates people. &nbsp;&amp; joins spouses (use&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 204);"></span>&amp; for spouses, and only for spouses).<br><br>&nbsp;Surnames
start with a capital letter, and surnames are not repeated (instead use
a comma, where a lower case letter following a comma indicates the same
surname as the prior person).<br>Thus:&nbsp; "Taylor willam
(farmer) &amp; ann" &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Obama barack &amp; michelle,
malia, sasha" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "James jesse, frank,

-- key issue is sale or other (other deeds include: QC quit claim,
mortgage, release, secure, bond, &nbsp;). &nbsp; When unsure it is best
to code the deed as a possible sale -- code deed as sale? &nbsp;and
highlight it for Jim's attention. &nbsp;<p>sale.enf &nbsp;: &nbsp;"enfeoff" &nbsp; The "deed"
variable is coded sale.enf&nbsp; if&nbsp;the word "enfeoff"
is used in the language that describes the transfer of the land (for
example, in Albany deeds "by these presents doth grant, bargain,
sell, alien, remise, release convey, assure <font color="#000000"><span style="background: rgb(255, 102, 102) none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">enfeoff</span></font>

enfeoff is not there (such as "grant bargain sell alien convey
and confirm" ). &nbsp;Be alert for the word "quit claim"
&nbsp;-- code that as QC and leave it for Jim to determine whether it
is a sale or not.</p><p></p>Type
